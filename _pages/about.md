I am a PhD student at the [Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/) since August 2019, working with [Dr. Bishakhdatta Gayen](https://sites.google.com/site/bishakhdattagayen/) and [Prof. Debasis Sengupta](https://iiscprofiles.irins.org/profile/54867).

After having done my senior secondary schooling from Jaipur (Rajasthan), I obtained my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) in 2018. It was here that I got interested in fluid dynamics as a subject. Thereafter I worked as 'Project Scientist B' at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) for a year, before joining IISc. Here is my [CV]()

My research interests lie in the broad field of Physical Oceanography and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics. Specifically, I am working on understanding upper ocean turbulence and mixing under various atmospheric conditions. Please refer to the [Research]() page for more details.

My hobbies include running and playing the violin.
