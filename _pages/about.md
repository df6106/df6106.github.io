I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Institute of Earth Sciences](https://en.earth.huji.ac.il/), at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/), since October 2025. I finished my PhD from the [Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/).

After having done my senior secondary schooling from Jaipur (Rajasthan), I obtained my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) in 2018. It was here that I got interested in fluid dynamics as a subject. Thereafter I worked as 'Project Scientist B' at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) for a year, before joining IISc. Here is my [CV](../files/Falor_Devang_CV.pdf).

My research interests lie in the broad field of Physical Oceanography and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics. Specifically, I am working on understanding upper ocean turbulence and mixing under various atmospheric conditions. Please refer to the [Research](research.md) page for more details.

My hobbies include running and playing the violin.
